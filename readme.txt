A collection of mods with some slight customization to create a core gameplay around long-distance logistics with a variety of vehicle types on a huge island world.

Start on a tiny island without any access to oil, and a limited amount of basic resources to begin with. 
Get started with Automation & Logistic science to research and construct a Boat.
Use vehicle based logistics from AAI Programmable Vehicles to exploit island resources from afar without needing to set up a rail network on every island.
Unlock Chemical Science with the very limited amount of oil provided by Crude Oil patches on land (roughly 20% what you'd find in vanilla).
Unlock Offshore Oil Rigs to exploit very rich Offshore Oil deposits and huge Cargo Ships to transport bulk goods.
Unlock automatable Airplanes to cross the vast distances between islands at a much faster speed, but with far less cargo space than ships.
Furhter refine oil and diversify the options with oil power with KS Powr and Schall Oil Fuel. Fuel your ships, planes, trucks, and trains with efficient refined Diesel Fuel, but the barrel it is stored i in is output as spent fuel.
Finally, unlock the Ballistic Missile Silo to exterminate island natives from afar.

Integrated Mods with changes made:

Cargo Ships: Ships & Offshore Oil
-Offshore power poles are disabled.
-Land oil is enabled by default, with the large Cargo Ship and Oil Tanker both locked behind Chemical Science.
-Offshore oil is greatly reduced in frequency due to the huge number of water chunks in Lotus Island World's map generation, and to make finding it not quite so trivial (It's still not rare)
-Offshore oil has been given an autoplace control in the map generation, allowing adjustment of it's frequency and abundance independent of land oil.

Resource Generation Overhaul: Balancing Resource Distribution
-Settings are customized to make sure islands aren't overly abundant/diverse with resources or overly barren.
-Oil in the starting area is disabled.

Diesel Fuel and additional options with Oil:
KS Power
Schall Oil Fuel

Planes:
Aircraft
Aircraft Realism

Changes:
-Only the new fuel type, which was not automatically integrated by Schall Oil Fuel.

Vehicles/Trucks:
AAI Programmable Vehicles
AAI Vehicles Hauler
AAI Vehicles Miner
AAI Vehicles Warden
AAI Vehicles Ironclad
Hovercrafts

Changes:
-No custom changes, but considered core to the transportation theme.

Island World Necessities:
Jetpack
Long Reach
Underwater Pipes
Remote Configuration
Ballistic Missile
Big Brother

Island generation script is modified off of Freight Forwarding, but does not rely on it as a dependency.

AAI Industry is a recommended but not required light overhaul mod that plays well with the mod pack. AAI Industry's fuel packs are disabled by default, as there is already custom fuel added, but that is the only integration.

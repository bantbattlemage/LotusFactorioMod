Version: 0.2.2
Date: 05. 26. 2023

Version: 0.2.1
Date: 05. 26. 2023
  Changes:
    - Offshore Oil spawns now obey map seed RNG. Previously the control of Offshore Oil spawns by this mod was using non-seeded RNG.
    - Further balanced Offshore Oil spawn rates.
    - Added some checks that should prevent a reported crash when spawning new chunks, but I wasn't able to reproduce the crash myself.
    - Updated thumbnail & screenshots, considering this version a "beta" release for the mod.

Version: 0.1.10
Date: 05. 25 .2023
  Changes:
    - Reverting unintended change made in previous commit of RGO area size from 10 to 12.
    - Changed mapgen values from numbers to string values that are used for mapgen to try to fix issue where map thinks settings are not default after loading into a map and then loading a new map, but it doesn't seem to have fixed it. Seems better to use these string values though so keeping this changes.
